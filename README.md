# Project Goal
Create an algorithmic trading bot that successfully trades and outperforms the strategy of buying and holding.  The Crypto coins we have selected to use is Bitcoin, Ethereum and Dogecoin.  

## About the project
 
## Data Preparation and Model Training
#### Data Preparation
 * Data sourced from Yfinance
 * Nulls dropped
 * Columns correctly renamed for later use.
#### Signal Indicators
 * Using EMA crossovers & overbought/oversold RSI to predict when the right time to buy, sell and hold is.
#### Machine Learning
 * We will be using the Logistic Regression model to predict the future portfolio value based on the selected cryptocurrencies.
#### Neural Network (TensorFlow & Keras)
 * Test neural networks and compare the predictions with the machine learning predictions
#### Displaying Predicted Portfolio Outcomes
 * Using HVPlot
#### Concluding Analysis
