#### Machine Learning
 * We will be using the Logistic Regression model to predict the future portfolio value based on the selected cryptocurrencies.
#### Neural Network (TensorFlow & Keras)
 * Test neural networks and compare the predictions with the machine learning predictions
#### Displaying Predicted Portfolio Outcomes
 * Using HVPlot
#### Concluding Analysis
